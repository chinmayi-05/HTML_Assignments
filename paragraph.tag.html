 Welcome of the course of html.
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.In HTML and CSS, syntax is the order in which elements appear or are written, meaning the grammar and spelling of the language. Syntax rules are in place to ensure the languages are always written in a way that can be read or interpreted by a computer.Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
